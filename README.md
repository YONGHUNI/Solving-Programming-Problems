# Background
This is a record of my problem-solving activities on PS (Problem Solving), which I have been doing as a hobby since March 22, 2022.

It all started from a need to retain the knowledge of Fortran that I learned during my double major in Atmospheric Science during university, and also from a desire to understand computer science better while studying Geographic Information Science (GIS).

The reason I used Fortran a lot for PS is as follows:
- The judging platform (Baekjoon) did not support features like the C++ STL in Fortran, so I had to implement many things on my own.
- Among the languages I knew, it was the fastest.
- The "romance" of being the language that sent humans to the moon.

Most of my Fortran code is written with the goal of **code golfing** (writing code as concisely as possible, which may affect readability). As a result, the indentation and structure are often not ideal, which can make the code harder to read.
