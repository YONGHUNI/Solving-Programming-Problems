# Background
This is a record of my problem-solving activities on **Baekjoon Online Judge**(It is basically a Korean version of LeetCode), which I have been doing as a hobby since March 22, 2022.

It all started from a need to retain the knowledge of Fortran that I learned during my double major in Atmospheric Science during university, and also from a desire to understand computer science better while studying Geographic Information Science (GIS).

The reason I used Fortran a lot for PS is as follows:
- The judging platform (Baekjoon) did not support features like the C++ STL in Fortran, so I had to implement many things on my own.
- Among the languages I knew, it was the fastest.
- The "romance" of being the language that sent humans to the moon.

Most of my Fortran code is written with the goal of **code golfing** (writing code as concisely as possible, which may affect readability). As a result, the indentation and structure are often not ideal, which can make the code harder to read.

# Baekjoon Difficulty and Level System

Baekjoon Online Judge categorizes problems into different difficulty levels and users into tiers based on their problem-solving abilities. Here's a breakdown:

### 1. **Problem Difficulty**
Problems are divided into five difficulty levels based on algorithmic complexity and problem-solving requirements:

- **Bronze**: Basic problems involving simple input/output and mathematical logic.
- **Silver**: Intermediate problems that require basic algorithms and data structures.
- **Gold**: Advanced problems involving complex algorithms and optimizations.
- **Platinum**: Very challenging problems requiring deep knowledge of algorithms and data structures.
- **Diamond**: Extremely difficult problems, often requiring high-level mathematical and algorithmic expertise.

### 2. **User Level System**
Users' levels are determined by the number and difficulty of problems theyâ€™ve solved. The levels are:

- **Bronze**: Basic skills, solving simple problems.
- **Silver**: Intermediate skills, understanding basic algorithms and data structures.
- **Gold**: Advanced skills, solving complex algorithmic problems.
- **Platinum**: High-level skills, solving optimization and challenging problems.
- **Diamond**: Elite level, solving very difficult problems with advanced algorithms.

### 3. **Level Up Criteria**
Your level is determined by:
- **Number of problems solved**
- **Difficulty of problems solved**

### 4. **Level Up Goals**
To improve your level:
- **Bronze**: Focus on basic problem-solving and algorithms.
- **Silver**: Master intermediate algorithms and data structures.
- **Gold**: Tackle more complex problems and focus on optimizations.
- **Platinum**: Solve advanced algorithmic challenges.
- **Diamond**: Reach the highest level by solving elite problems.

This system helps users systematically improve their problem-solving skills and track their progress.
